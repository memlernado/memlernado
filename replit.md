# Getting Started

## Developer Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database (Neon is recommended for cloud hosting)
- Git for version control

### Installation & Environment Setup
1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Environment Configuration**: Set up the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_key
   ```
4. **Database Setup**: 
   - Create your PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended)
   - Run database migrations to set up the schema:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

### Running the Application
- **Development mode**: Start both backend and frontend servers:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This runs the Express backend and Vite frontend on the same port (5000)
- **Access the application**: Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser

### Development Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development servers (backend + frontend)
- `npm run build` - Build frontend for production  
- `npm run db:push` - Sync database schema with Drizzle migrations
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate new migration files for schema changes

### Architecture Notes
- Backend and frontend run on the same port (5000) via Vite configuration
- No separate proxy setup needed - Vite handles API route forwarding
- Hot reload enabled for both frontend and backend during development

## User Setup Instructions
1. **Authentication**: Login with your facilitator or learner credentials
2. **Workspace Creation**: Create a new workspace for your family/group or join an existing one
3. **Sprint Setup**: Navigate to sprint planning to create your first learning sprint
4. **Task Management**: Add learning tasks, assign them to learners, and track progress

## User Roles & Workflows

- **Form Validation**: Required fields enforced with helpful error messages
- **Status Tracking**: Automatic progress tracking as tasks move through workflow

## Workspace Features
- **Multi-workspace Support**: Create separate environments for different families or groups
- **Member Management**: Add family members with appropriate roles (facilitator/learner)
- **Workspace Switching**: Use navigation dropdown to switch between workspaces
- **Real-time Sync**: Workspace list updates immediately when new workspaces are created

# Recent Changes (September 2025)

## Sprint Development Session - Major Feature Completion

### âœ… Drag & Drop Implementation

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with React and TypeScript using Vite as the build tool. The application follows a component-based architecture with:

- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives for consistent, accessible design
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme variables for consistent branding and child-friendly design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management with optimistic updates
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Authentication**: Context-based auth provider with protected routes
- **Layout**: Modular layout system with navigation, sidebar, and main content areas

The frontend is organized into logical directories: components (reusable UI), pages (route components), hooks (custom React hooks), and lib (utilities and configuration).

## Backend Architecture
The server uses Express.js with TypeScript in an ESM module setup. Key architectural decisions include:

- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy using session-based auth stored in PostgreSQL
- **Password Security**: Scrypt-based password hashing with salt for secure credential storage
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling and request/response logging
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL session store for persistence
- **Middleware**: Custom logging middleware for API request tracking

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations:

- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL for cloud hosting and scalability
- **ORM**: Drizzle with schema-first approach providing full TypeScript integration
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema management and migrations
- **Connection**: Connection pooling via @neondatabase/serverless for optimal performance

## Database Schema Design
The schema supports multi-tenant workspaces with role-based access:

- **Users**: Core user data with role distinction (facilitator/learner)
- **Workspaces**: Family or group learning environments
- **Workspace Members**: Many-to-many relationship with role assignments
- **Sprints**: Time-boxed learning periods with active/inactive states
- **Tasks**: Learning activities with status tracking, assignment, and progress monitoring

## External Dependencies

- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL serverless database
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessible component foundation
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit for Kanban board task manipulation
- **Development Tools**: Replit-specific plugins for development environment integration
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form management
